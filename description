Project Description
The Virtual Toaster — Mallu Punchline Edition is a humorous web-based simulation that allows users to "toast" a slice of bread visually. Upon completion, the toaster plays a sizzling sound, a Malayalam meme punchline, and displays a random meme. It's a fun way to experience the joy of toasting without the calories!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt the need to toast bread but lacked the energy or ingredients? Or perhaps you wanted to experience the joy of toasting without the hassle? This project addresses that non-existent dilemma by providing a virtual toasting experience.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution is a web-based toaster simulator that:

Toasts a virtual slice of bread.

Plays a sizzling sound during the toasting process.

Delivers a random Malayalam meme punchline upon completion.

Displays a random meme to entertain the user.

All this, without the need for actual bread or a toaster!
